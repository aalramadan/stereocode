# ðŸ›  **Stereocode 1.0**


## ðŸ’¡ **What does it do?**
**Stereocode** classifies **methods** and **classes** based on their **stereotypes**.

> Class and method stereotypes are defined in two papers presented at the **IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM)** in 2006 and 2010 by Dragan, Collard, and Maletic.

**Stereocode**  takes a srcML-formatted archive as input, performs static analysis on the code, and annotates the srcML with labels indicating the detected stereotypes. The output is a srcML archive with stereotype attributes embedded within class and function tags. An optional report summarizing the stereotypes of classes and their methods can also be generated.

*This output can be used for further processing or analysis. For instance, the stereotype information can be embedded as documentation in the source code (using comments, **Doxygen**, **Javadoc**, etc.).*

The tool currently supports **C++**, **Java**, and **C#**.

## ðŸ”§ Installation and Build
1. Prerequisites
- [srcml 1.1+](https://www.srcml.org/)
- [cmake 3.17+](https://cmake.org/)

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Build using cmake:

```bash
cmake CMakeLists.txt -B build_path
cd build_path
make
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

**Stereocode**  is a command-line tool.

It can process individual files, multiple files, or entire systems. The input is expected to be in srcML format. 

Demo: 
```bash
# Process PowerShell-CS.xml and store the output in PowerShell-CS.stereotypes.xml
./stereocode PowerShell-CS.xml

# Save the output in PowerShell-CS-output.xml
./stereocode PowerShell-CS.xml -o PowerShell-CS-output.xml

# Overwrite the input file with stereotype output 
./stereocode PowerShell-CS.xml -v

# Generate an output PowerShell-CS.stereotypes.xml and an optional report PowerShell-CS.xml.report.txt
./stereocode PowerShell-CS.xml -r
```

There are a predefined set of primitive (base) types for each language.  Additional primitive type (system specific) can be supplied by the user <span style='color: lightgreen;'>**(-p --primitives option)**</span> as follows:

```
./stereocode PowerShell-CS.xml -p primitive-file.txt
```
The **primitive-file.txt** should list data types, one per line, without spaces. Example:
```
longlong
intlong
```

For more options and help:
```bash
./stereocode --help
./OrderBy --help
```


## ðŸ“œ Stereocode Options

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-o, --output-file:**</span> Specify the output file name.

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-p, --primitives:**</span> Specify file name of user defined primitive/base types (one per line without spaces).  This is added to initial list of primitive types. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-r, --report:**</span> Generate an optional report file named *.report.txt. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-v, --overwrite:**</span> Overwrite the input file with stereotype output. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-c, --large-class \[int]:**</span> Define a parameter to determine the large-class stereotype. Default is 21.

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-s, --stereotype-views:**</span> Output optional CSV files capturing different views of method and class stereotypes - *.view_type.csv".


## ðŸ“„ Output

By default, **Stereocode** generates an annotated archive for each input, and optionally, a report file. An option to generate only a report file is also available.

The class and function tags are given a stereotype attribute, e.g.::
```XML
<class st:stereotype="entity"> ... </class>
<function st:stereotype="get"> ... </function>
```


## ðŸ““ Developer Notes:

The initial version of this code base was developed by Doleh and documented in his MS Thesis December 2021 at Kent State University. Previously, a prototype of **Stereocode** was developed by Collard and Dragan for Dragan's dissertation in December 2010 at KSU.  This prototype was further extended for DySDoc 2018 by Decker and Collard.
